Wind Speed and Direction Prediction Using ML Methods
High wind causes many significant negative impacts on society, the economy, and the
environment on a local, regional, and global scale. Strong winds can generate many
factors like sand and dust storms and sea hurricanes. The environmental and health
risks of such storms cannot be permanently reduced, but their impact can be reduced
by taking appropriate precautions.

High winds can cause trees to fall, debris to fly, and buildings to collapse, which can
lead to power outages, transportation disruptions, damage to buildings and vehicles,
and injury or death. It also can cause dusty waves, often in the afternoon and evening
hours, with which the horizontal visibility significantly decreases specifically Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia.

The main motive for doing this project is to forecast the wind speed and direction one
day ahead (24h). We selected the west coast of the Saudi Arabia area as a station for
our analysis. The tools being used are Machine Learning methods and algorithms
and Microsoft Excel for the datasets.

The project aims to forecast the wind speed and direction several hours to one
week ahead, looking if the wind speed affects the visibility, temperature, and
Humidity. By using machine learning algorithms.

Objectives
We will be dealing with this situation by:
1- Collecting data from reliable sources.
2- Forecasting wind speed.
3- Forecasting wind direction.
4- Using machine learning algorithms and comparison with previous works.
5- Measure sure if wind speed can affect vision or not.

Target users
We think that this project will have many beneficiaries for example:
1- Citizen
2- Governmental and private establishments.
3- National Meteorological Center.
4- Airports and ports.

Project Methodology
1- Obtain the data and gather it from relevant sources.
2- Clean the data to formats that the machine understands.
3- Find significant patterns and trends using statistical methods.
4- Construct models to predict and forecast.
5- Put the results into good use.

Project Plan
We will locate every station in the west of the kingdom of Saudi Arabi and analyze
each one to figure out which station records the highest wind speed, by using the tools
we learned through the time our study in the university to reduce the impact of
future high wind speed.

Tools and requirements
We will be using the best tools for our project to get the best results as data
scientists. These tools are as follows:
 Machine learning:
• Python:
• Random Forest
• SVM
• Pandas
• Logistic Regression
• NumPy
 MS Excel:
• Dataset

Conclusion
At the end of our project, we hope that we give real solutions from what we taught
all over the years at the university. High wind speed is a real danger and should be
fought with science, while using the tools we learned from our journey, to help at
least reduce the impact of the High wind speed.
